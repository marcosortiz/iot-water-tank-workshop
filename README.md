# IoT Water Tank Workshop

Monitoring remote oilfield assets has always been challenging given traditional SCADA (Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition) and network limitations. With accurate real time data, oil & gas operators can reduce operating expenses, minimize downtime, and improve safety. 

In this builder session, you will learn how to setup an edge hardware and software solution to monitor a water tank level. We will use the following AWS services: AWS IoT Greengrass, AWS IoT Core, AWS IoT Events, Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon SNS.

The picture bellow, illustrates the overall architecture of what we will be building.
